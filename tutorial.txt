---+ Blipkit

This document is designed to be viewed via pldoc at this URL:

http://www.berkeleybop.org/blipdoc/

This code should be considered pre-alpha. Much of the code itself is
in use and appears robust. However, I may be making major
organisational changes (ie module and predicate naming). You have been
warned!

The majority of this library is focused around ontologies. There are
some modules for sequence and feature data, but these are currently
being developed on an as-needed basis.

Currently the focus is on data and querying. I may include parsers at
a later date. SWI has decent XML and tabular parsing mechanisms, but
for the most part data is pre-converted to prolog factfiles using the
scripts in the bin directory.

---+ Prerequisites

SWI-Prolog; tested on 5.7.x

http://www.swi-prolog.org/

You are recommended to use the the latest version, in the 5.7.x
series. 5.6.x may suffice for most purposes though.

If you are installing from source you should build all packages. In
particular:

* odbc - if you want to connect to relational databases
* semweb - if you want to use OWL/RDF
* sgml - for any XML formats

Building prolog with GMP support is recommended, and required for some
modules, such as simmatrix.pro

---++ Dependencies (optional)

* go-perl (for obo files)
* graphviz (for drawing network and ontology graphs)
* Thea2 (for OWL2), available from http://github.com/vangelisv/thea

Some of the support scripts require perl. If you want to convert
ontology files (OBO,OWL,etc) to prolog fact files you will need
go-perl (0.02) from CPAN

---+ Download

For now it is recommended you get the latest version from svn

Anonymous checkout:

==
svn co svn://code.open-bio.org/blipkit/trunk blipkit
==

Developer checkout:

==
svn co svn+ssh://dev.open-bio.org/home/svn-repositories/blipkit/trunk/ blipkit
==

---+ Installation

---++ Standard Installation Procedure

Standard unix/linux install:

==
./configure
make bin/blip
sudo make install
==

By default, the library will go in your swi prolog lib directory, and
scripts will go somewhere like /usr/bin. You can override this using
standard configure parameters, for example:

==
./configure --with-pllibdir=/users/me/bio --bindir=/users/me/bio/bin
sudo make install
==

Once installed you should use the command line program =|blip|= to
access blipkit functionality via the prolog shell. This sets up your
prolog file_search_path to fetch the blip libraries from the installed
location.

---++ Developers Installation Procedure

If you wish to use this lib in development-mode, change your ~/.plrc to
something like:

==
user:file_search_path(blipkit, '/users/me/cvs/blipkit/packages/blip').
user:prolog_file_type(pro,prolog).
user:trusted_user(true).
==

changing the first line to where you have blip checked out.

The second line is necessary because the blip source files use the
.pro suffix, but if you do a full install, they will get the .pl
suffix. If you are working from the source files you need to tell
prolog you're using the non-standard .pro suffix

Once you have have created or edited your .plrc file, you can set up
your own configuration file, using the standard one as default.

==
mkdir ~/.blip
cp blipkit/etc/bioconf.pro ~/.blip/
==

Now edit your local bioconf.pro file

This file allows you to use abbreviations for bioinformatics resources
- e.g. "go" for the gene ontology OBO file

You will also want to set up the blip script to point to your
swi-prolog location:

==
./configure
make bin/blip
==

You can add this to your PATH in your .profile or .bashrc; for example:

==
if [ -d $HOME/blipkit ]; then
. $HOME/blipkit/etc/blipkit-profile.sh
fi
==


---+ Troubleshooting

See notes above for doing the full install

---+ Interacting via prolog shell

Typing =|blip|= in a unix shell should get you started, placing you in a prolog shell:

==
% blip
Starting blip shell
==

Use load_biofile/2 to download a resource into the in-memory prolog database:

==
?- load_biofile(obo,url('http://purl.org/obo/obo-all/cell/cell.obo')).
Correct to: "io:load_biofile(obo, url(http://purl.org/obo/obo-all/cell/cell.obo))"? yes
true.
==

Note: for this to work you will need to install go-perl from CPAN. Fetch this from http://search.cpan.org/~cmungall/go-perl/

Alternatively you can download the pre-made prolog database like this:

==
?- load_biofile(ontol_db:pro,url('http://purl.org/obo/obo-all/cell/cell.pro)).
==

Or if you have setup bioconf.pro, like this:

==
?- load_bioresource(obop(cell)).
==


A simple query using class/2 to find the ID of the class named "astrocyte"

==
?- class(X,astrocyte).
Correct to: "ontol_db:class(X, astrocyte)"? yes
X = 'CL:0000127' .
==

Using subclassT/2 to find the closure of subclass/2 for astrocyte:

==
?- class(X,astrocyte),subclassT(X,Y),class(Y,YN).
Correct to: "ontol_db:class(X, astrocyte)"? yes
Correct to: "ontol_db:subclassT(X, Y)"? yes
Correct to: "ontol_db:class(Y, YN)"? yes
X = 'CL:0000127',
Y = 'CL:0000126',
YN = 'macroglial cell' ;
X = 'CL:0000127',
Y = 'CL:0000243',
YN = 'glial cell (sensu Vertebrata)' ;
X = 'CL:0000127',
Y = 'CL:0000125',
YN = 'glial cell' ;
false.
==

---+ Bioresources

If you are working with a lot of datafiles, you can set up a bioconf
file that will map logical names to the full physical path of the
resource

For example, if you are working with GO a lot, you want to avoid
having to type the full path to wherever your gene_ontology.obo file
is. The bioconf file allows you to set up such a mapping.

First, Edit the existing etc/bioconf.pro file; Edit the search path
where the GO dir is found. Ignore all lines pertaining to resources
you do not wish to use.

Now add this line to your ~/.plrc file:

==
:- ['/users/me/bioprolog/etc/bioconf'].
==

(modifying it to where you have this software checked out)

At some point in the future, it will be possible to fetch these
resources over the web

---+ Applications

There are some scripts in the bin directory. They will be installed in
/usr/local/bin by default (can be overridden with configure options)

Some of the scripts are little hacks that I'm using for a particular
project that happen to live with this package for convenience -
they'll probably go shortly

You can pass in an ontology fact file as an argument, or you can
specify a logical resource name; see examples/example-plrc for setting
up logical resource mappings

the resource can be specified on the command line; eg:

==
blip ontol-subset -r go -n 'cysteine biosynthesis'
==

---+ Serval

(*Serv*er-*A*pplication-*L*ogic)
 
Serval is a lightweight web application framework for developing www
interfaces. See lib/serval.pro

Currently serval is bundled with bioprolog, due to shared dependencies
on bioprolog_util. They may be separated in the future (OPEN-Q: should
the shared utils be duplicated or moved into a 3rd library?)

Currently the prototype new amigo app is bundled together with
bioprolog and serval - in future it may be separated

See examples/serval for an example server

Run the script "serval" to start a server (default port 8080)

Serval has no dependencies other than SWI Prolog
