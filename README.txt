---+ Blipkit : Biomedical Logic Programming Toolkit

Blip is a collection of logic programming modules intended primarily
for bioinformatics and biomedical applications, although it contains
some modules which may be of more general interest. Blip is intended
to be both an application library, and a deductive database/query
system. Blip is written in SWI-Prolog, a fast, robust and scalable
implementation of ISO Prolog.
